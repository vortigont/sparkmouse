# sparkmouse
sample mouse HID device code for DigiSpark board.
This small ATiny based board behaves as a mouse plugged into USB port and
does some small random mouse movements. Why do you need that? Who knows... maybe you do not have a mouse and want to do some tests...
or you hate when someone enforces an annoying screen locking policy on your laptop? :)
